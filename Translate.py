#     There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
# And she's buying a stairway to heaven
# And when she gets there, she knows if the stores are all closed
# With a word she can get what she came for
#
# Oohoohooh oohoohoohoohooh
#
# And she's buying a stairway to heaven
#
# There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
# 'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
# In a tree by the brook there's a songbird that sings
# Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
#
# And I think you can see that
#
# Ohh
#
# [Chorus]
# And it makes me wonder, sure does
# Oh hoh hoh, hohooh ohoohohooh, yes sir
#
# [Verse 2]
# There's a feelin' I get when I look to the west
# And my spirit is crying for leaving
# In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
# And the voices of those who stand looking
#
# Ah hah. Ah hah
# Ah hah. Ah hah. Ahhhahhohoohohooh
#
# [Verse 3]
# And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
# Then the piper will lead us to reason
# And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
# And the forests will echo with laughter
#
# Does anybody remember laughter?
#
# Baby! Oh, baby look...
# Just give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
#
# Sure does, sure does
#
# But I got some good news, listen...
#
# [Verse 4]
# If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
# It's just a spring clean for the May queen
# Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
# There's still time to change the road you're on
#
# I hope so
#
# Oohh! Baby, baby, baby
# Ya, darlin' babe
# Ya, darlin' babe
# Ya, darlin' babe
#
# Wait a minute...
#
# [Verse 5]
# Your head is hummin' and it won't go in case ya don't know
# The piper's callin' you to join him
# Dear Lady, can you hear the wind blow and did you know
# Your stairway lies on the whisperin' wind?
#
# Ohh hah hahhahhh
#
# [Guitar Solo]
#
# [Bridge]
# And as we wind on down the road
# Our shadows taller than our souls
# There walks a lady we all know
# Who shines white light and wants to show
# How everything still turns to gold, yeah
# And if you listen very hard
# The tune will come to you at last
# When all is one and one is all
# To be a rock and not to roll, not to roll
#
# [Outro]
# And she's buying a stairway to heaven
# Ahhahhhhohhahhoh
